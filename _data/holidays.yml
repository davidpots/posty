- name: Memorial Day
  description: "Memorial Day is a federal holiday commemorating the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. It also marks the unofficial start of the summer vacation season. Since this day has two (tonally very different) meanings in American culture, it‚Äôs customary to honor this day in a multitude of ways. Some participate in community parades, which are tributes to those who have died while serving (like ceremonies at memorials and cemeteries or tribute concerts). Some celebrate the kick-off to summer with outdoor BBQs, spending time in the sunshine, or vacations."

- name: Juneteenth
  description: "Juneteenth is a holiday that celebrates the official end of slavery in all 50 states. The Emancipation Proclamation in 1862 declared that slaves were to be freed in the rebellious states, but states that weren't occupied by Union soldiers weren't able (or willing) to effectively enforce the new order immediately. It wasn't until June 19, 1865, that every state announced the abolition of slavery ‚Äì the last being Texas. Today, the holiday is considered a joyous day in which we celebrate freedom and equality. With the Black Lives Matter movement and protests prevalent across the country and in mainstream conversations and news outlets, discussions around the struggles and injustices that Black people face has been heavily noted over the last few years in particular. This is something to keep in mind as you create your customer-requested Juneteenth post. Think about tone very carefully while writing your caption, and don't hesitate to reach out to your manager if you have questions or concerns about your post."
