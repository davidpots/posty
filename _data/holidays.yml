- name: Easter
  description: "Easter is a Christian holiday marking the date Jesus rose from the dead after being crucified on Good Friday. Many members of the faith observe by attending Easter mass or service. Over time, celebrations for the holiday have expanded beyond the Christian faith, too. Many families will spend the day dyeing eggs for scavenger hunts, going to brunch, and gifting Easter baskets stuffed with candy and other goodies. For many, Easter unofficially marks the beginning of spring. This year, with the pandemic, it‚Äôs likely people will be celebrating Easter differently than usual."
  emoji: ‚úùÔ∏è
  posting_recommendation: "You're encouraged to schedule a post for customers who might benefit from the non-religious aspects of the holiday. Businesses that sell sweets, cards, little gifts that might be good for an Easter basket, etc., could benefit from a post encouraging people to make those purchases before the holiday.<br /><br />Likewise, restaurants that have Sunday brunch would benefit from a post reminding followers to make a reservation or plans to see them. (However, keep in mind our COVID-19 posting requirements, and be certain of your customer‚Äôs policies and current operations during this time. We don‚Äôt want to suggest indoor dining for a customer who is only doing takeout.)<br /><br />Keep in mind that posts like this should be scheduled before Easter so consumers have enough time to go out and buy the items or plan ahead for a reservation."
