# - name: Cinco de Mayo
#   description: "Cinco de Mayo is an annual celebration commemorating the victory of the Mexican army against the French empire during the Franco-Mexican War. It is not Mexican Independence Day, but it does represent a significant moment in Mexican history. In the US, celebrations often include parades, parties, mariachi music, and traditional Mexican food and drinks. This year, due to the pandemic, people may be celebrating Cinco de Mayo differently."

# - name: Ramadan
#   description: "Ramadan represents a time of worship and self-reflection for Muslims. Throughout the entire month, observers participate by fasting (abstaining from all eating and drinking) from dawn to sunset, praying often, and reciting from the Quran. Members of the faith are also asked to abstain from 'sinful activities,' including smoking, sexual relations, and swearing. The day after Ramadan ends marks the beginning of Eid al-Fitr, which is the celebration of successfully completing a month of fasting."

- name: Memorial Day
  description: "Memorial Day is a federal holiday commemorating the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. It also marks the unofficial start of the summer vacation season. Since this day has two (tonally very different) meanings in American culture, it’s customary to honor this day in a multitude of ways. Some participate in community parades, which are tributes to those who have died while serving (like ceremonies at memorials and cemeteries or tribute concerts). Some celebrate the kick-off to summer with outdoor BBQs, spending time in the sunshine, or vacations."
