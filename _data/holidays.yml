- name: Ramadan
  description: "Ramadan represents a time of worship and self-reflection for Muslims. Throughout the entire month, observers participate by fasting (abstaining from all eating and drinking) from dawn to sunset, praying often, and reciting from the Quran. Members of the faith are also asked to abstain from 'sinful activities,' including smoking, sexual relations, and swearing. The day after Ramadan ends marks the beginning of Eid al-Fitr, which is the celebration of successfully completing a month of fasting."
