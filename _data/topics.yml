Discard stale or outdated foods and spices. -Thoroughly clean the inside of your cabinets and replace old shelf paper. -Vacuum behind your appliances—there’s probably a good bit of dust back there! -Clear off your counters and give them a good scrub, looking out for any sticky spots or residue in hard-to-reach areas."

- name: Solid vs. Engineered Hardwood
  description: "Solid hardwood flooring typically comes in long planks, milled with tongues and grooves on opposite edges so that the boards interlock when installed. It is always nailed down to the subfloor, a process that requires some skill. Because it is solid wood, this flooring can be sanded down and refinished several times over its life. Engineered flooring looks like solid hardwood, but it's made of a thin layer of hardwood bonded over a premium-quality plywood layer for added stability. It is both less expensive and easier for DIYers to install than solid hardwood."
