- name: Appraisal
  description: "In order to get a loan from a bank to buy a home, you first need to get the home appraised so the bank can be sure they are lending the correct amount of money. The appraiser will determine the value of the home based on an examination of the property itself, as well as the sale price of comparable homes in the area. It's common that people may not know the actual worth of their homes or the ones they're interested in buying. Knowledge is power -- emphasize the benefits of hiring an outside appraiser."

- name: Pre-approval letter
  description: "Before buying a home, a buyer can obtain a pre-approval letter from a bank, which provides an estimate on how much the bank will lend that person. This letter will help determine what the buyer can afford. Getting pre-approved should be the first step for every buyer in their home search. It helps them determine what to look for and what's in their budget."

- name: Interest rates
  description: "We know that interest rates are the lowest they've been in a while, but how does a lender calculate what an interest rate might look like for an individual buyer? Here are some factors they might consider when making that decision: Credit score -- if a buyer's credit score is higher, their interest rate will likely be lower. Down payment -- if a client puts less than 20% down on a property purchase, the lender might require mortgage insurance, which requires a slightly higher interest rate. Loan term -- in general, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates and lower overall costs, but higher monthly payments. Interest rate type -- fixed interest rates are locked in, but adjustable rates fluctuate based on the market after an initial period. This means clients might qualify for a lower rate early on, but the rate could gradually increase."

- name: Foreclosure
  description: "Foreclosure is the process of a lender seizing and selling a property to a new buyer when the owner fails to make their mortgage payments as agreed.

Other states offer options that don't require a court to get involved. They also might be priced to sell quickly because of the lender’s need to recoup their losses."
